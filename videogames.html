    <h3>Characters</h3>
    <p>
        <br> Here are some of my favorite characters in Animal Crossing: NHR. 
        <br>They are called villagers, and you can "collect" them and add them to your island.
        <br> They have different personalities and do different activities. There are animals and humanoids alike.

    <div class="GameHazard">
        <p>
            <br>Although it is a fun enriching game, there are multiple faults that could occur.
            <br>You could be hacked and your account password compromised
            <br>You could also be scammed by websites claiming to provide free "Robux", the games currency which you need to pay real money for. With it, you may buy virtual items.
            <br>In order to prevent this, go to <a href="https://education.roblox.com/en-us/resources/intro-to-digital-safety">this website</a> to learn more about digital saftey on roblox.

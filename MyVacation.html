       <P>
           Are you looking to travel to a city famous for the Golden Gate Bridge, along with its delicious food selections? Well you've picked the right place!
           <br>
           San Francisco is a beautiful city, with many attractions to visit. To name a few; Golden Gate Park, California Academy of Sciences, or Lombard Street.
           <br>I personally have been to all those places and they were amazing! Golden Gate Park offers great photo oppurtunities, while CAoS is a wonderful museum with a ferris wheel 2 minutes away. Lombard street is a thrill to drive through!

       <p id="specialparaduplicate">
           If you've done all your sightseeing in SF, why don't you take a drive down to San Jose, which is roughly 50 minutes away.
           <br>
           San Jose is surrounded by hills, in a place called <I>Silicon Valley</I>,a place for all things technology. 
           <br>Here, you can see many museums based on companies such as the intel museum, tech interactive, googleplex, and others.
           <br>You may also consider visitng chinatown either here or in San Francisco

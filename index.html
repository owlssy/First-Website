        <br> About This Website:
        <br>
        <br>This website is a compilation of multiple pages that feature things I'm interested in.
        <br>You can learn more about different categories such as video games, good travel destinations, and books.
        <br>The logo was inspired by my favorite animal and color. I found it on google :)

        <br>About Me!
        <br>
        <br>This is my first website! I'm going to 7th grade and hoping to one day become a doctor. 
        <br>In my spare time, I do Tae Kwon Do and golf.
        <br>You'll also usually find me with either a computer or book in my hands, or playing with my younger sister.

        <br>Like I mentioned earlier, this is my first website. So, I'd love it if you could leave me some suggestions! They could be about new content, or things I should work on to make this a better experience.
        <br>Please either <a href="feedback.html">click here</a> or access the "feedback" page from the navigation page!
        <br>Thank you!

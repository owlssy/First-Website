        <p>Welcome to my first entry on this page!<br>
        Today, I'm going to be telling you about the book <i>Aru Shah and The City of Gold.</i> It is the fourth book in the series and it came out in April of this year! Before I explain anymore, this is a book series about Hindu mythology and has a concept that needs to be clarified. <br>
            <br> The concept is the <big>Pandavas!</big> If you read the first 3 books you will know what this is and if you didn't, they are essentially rebirthed every time they die. So, their souls still remain. Their soul fathers were gods, and whoever becomes pandava next gets a special weapon and access to the overworld. BUT the twist in this book series is that they are all sisters, while before they were all brothers. That's one reason I love this book series so much. Ok, so now that you know what a pandava is, let's get on with the plot.
        </p>
            <p>
            The plot is that Aru, the main character, wakes up in the Sleeper's cave. The Sleeper is one of the antagonists of the story and is Aru's father who turned evil.
        Then, she meets a girl named Kara who is supposedly related to the sleeper and technically Aru's sister. So Aru and her sisters Brynne and Mini and their friend Aiden (whom is the Pandava's wife incarnated which is <i>really funny</i>) must find their mentors Hanuman and Urvashi in Lanka, the city of gold, before war breaks out between the devas and asuras. Aru has just made a wish on the tree of wishes, but she can't remember what it was because of a curse she recieved in the last book.
        <br> If I had to rate this book on a scale from 1-5 I would 100% give it five stars! There is such good humor, great plot twists, awesome characters, and you learn about hindu mythology! 5 stars!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

           This was my first manga series and i thought it was great. It is published in english and read left to right, like the traditional japanese style. it takes a bit of getting used to, but its a great series. In all it has 63 books.
